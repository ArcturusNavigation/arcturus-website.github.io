                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>
                      Starting off this new school year, our team focused
                      heavily on recruitment and onboarding during the first few
                      weeks of school because we want to ensure that everyone
                      who has an interest in marine robotics has an opportunity
                      to participate. We especially focused on developing useful
                      training materials for each sub team, as experience level
                      varies greatly from person to person. From participating
                      in the Activities Midway to giving tours at the MIT Sea
                      Grant lab, we successfully wrapped up recruiting with lots
                      of new faces at our general meeting. The onboarding
                      trainings for each sub team were also carefully divided to
                      first develop some basic knowledge/skills before moving on
                      to more Arcturus related topics. Now, each subteam is
                      starting to dive into smaller projects to create our new
                      flagship for the 2025 competition season.
                    </p>

                    <h3>MechE</h3>
                    <p>
                      The MechE team began thinking about designs for the new
                      competition boat. We started by considering our design
                      parameters, and set the general dimensions of the boat
                      that we want to make. Next, we designed the hulls using
                      these dimensions, and thought of our general design
                      parameters on the boat. The MechE team then split into
                      groups working on different aspects of the boat, including
                      groups for:

                      <li>
                        Deck, who worked on the dimensions of the deck, its

                      <li>
                        Thrusters, who figured out methods of mounting the
                        thrusters to the hulls and made cages so that the boat
                        can be set down without interference from the thrusters

                      <li>
                        Command Module, who designed the housing for some of the
                        electronics as well as a method to get the LIDAR as high
                        as possible for maximum vision capabilities

                      <li>
                        Battery Box, who worked on the way that the batteries
                        are set into and accessed from the hulls
                      </li>

                    <p>
                      In the coming weeks, we plan to continue with these
                      designs and do both internal and external design reviews
                      to refine them and ensure that it will work the way that
                      we want it to.

                    <h3>EE</h3>
                    <p>
                      The EE team approached the new semester with a new vision
                      of the standards we want to adhere to and the abilities we
                      want our electronic systems to have. Secondly, for the term
                      team came up with 8 subprojects EE will thoroughly
                      develop:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Thermal Management - our electronics box is already
                        cool, but we need to make it cooler. Right now we are
                        researching the most effective ways for thermal
                        management and creating heat transfer simulations.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Batteries and Battery Box - batteries must be protected
                        at all costs, therefore we care about battery boxes.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Power Distribution - we want our electronics box to be
                        more organized and reliable, therefore we are developing
                        a PCB which will take care of all power transformation
                        and distribution to the specific elements in the box.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        BMS - our current BMS does its job, but we are looking
                        for ways to integrate it more closely with the software
                        stack we have and be able to read the battery charge
                        percentages without using a 3rd party application.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        LED Signal Board - LEDs, LEDs, LEDs. EE wants to help
                        implement faster in-water boat tests, and a strip of
                        LEDs visible from the outside of the box signaling about
                        the state of subsystems would be helpful for quicker
                        deployments.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Box-like container - we are working with MechE to
                        implement the next-gen box design.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Remote E-Stop Board - EE is designing a PCB to
                        replace the E-Stop protoboard.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Led Tower Board - EE is designing a PCB to replace
                        the Led Tower protoboard.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      A group of 2-5 people work on each subproject, with a
                      great share of those involved being new members of the
                      team. In the coming weeks, we plan to continue working on
                      the projects and introduce new members of the team to our
                      development process.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Autonomy</h3>
                    <p>
                      As this is the beginning of a new season and there are
                      fresh faces in the organization, the Autonomy subteam has
                      spent the past few weeks in the onboarding phase. The main
                      activity at every meeting has been making sure everyone
                      has the proper software, processes, and permissions set up
                      on their systems such as virtual machines and dual boots
                      capable of running linux for ROS 2 as well as git accounts
                      with access to the organization git repositories. Besides
                      this, the autonomy lead Jacob has been educating the new
                      recruits about the focus of the different sub teams within
                      the autonomy group and how they interact with each other.
                      In addition, he has explained the basics of the ROS 2
                      nodes and topics system, Github collaboration, Linux,
                      MOOS, and how we use these software to efficiently create
                      the programs vital to running the vehicle. Along the way,
                      new members have been placed onto their preferred subteams
                      and given introductory tasks to simulate what the rest of
                      the year will look like as part of that group.

                    <h3>MechE</h3>
                    <p>
                      During the 2023-24 season, the MechE team is going to
                      design and build a completely new boat for future
                      competitions. To ensure sustainability within our
                      subsystem, we’re having one of the biggest pushes for
                      training that the MechE team has ever done. We’ll be
                      running trainings for almost all aspects of the mechanical
                      design process, including Computer Aided Design and
                      Manufacturing, using bandsaws and drill presses, and laser
                      cutting and 3D printing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Mechanically, we’ll start our first build by making
                      adjustments to our test boat, <i>Athena</i>, giving it an
                      X drive configuration and a new sensor mast that will
                      match our plans for the new competition boat. This should
                      be a reasonably fast adjustment which will allow us to
                      transition quickly to working on the design of the new
                      boat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The process of building a new boat will begin with
                      designing the hulls and deck in CAD. Once we have a
                      preliminary design completed, we will do design reviews
                      within our team with the Electrical and Autonomy subteams.
                      We also plan to work with some of the professors of
                      mechanical engineering at MIT who specialize in working on
                      boat designs. When we have a design that we’re happy with,
                      we will begin the manufacturing and layup process,
                      assemble the hulls and deck, and hand the boat off to
                      Electrical and Autonomy for integration and testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Overall, the mechanical team’s goal is to make a new boat
                      that properly caters to the needs of Electrical and
                      Autonomy, and gives the team a good foundation to perform
                      well in future competitions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>EE</h3>
                    <p>
                      For the 2023-2024 season, the EE team is planning on doing
                      a whole revamp of our electronic system. Our general
                      circuit will likely remain quite similar, but individual
                      parts will be designed more robustly. We also plan to work
                      on expanding our team since many members are seniors, and
                      so we want to create documentation of what we have
                      accomplished and learned thus far.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To create a more robust electronics box, we plan to
                      convert our protoboards into PCBs. This task will help
                      teach the entire team, new and old members, the process
                      for creating small PCBs. We hope that this will give our
                      team a chance to get comfortable with Altium so this
                      design process becomes less of a barrier for creating PCBs
                      in the future. We also hope to find stronger connectors
                      for jumper wires inside the box, since these become loose
                      over time and tend to break if they are moved around too
                      often. Next, we are planning to improve our cable
                      management inside the box, and we hope that by introducing
                      rails along the sides of our box, and also by using PCBs,
                      we will create a box that is more organized and easier to
                      debug. This will also include replacing our pass through
                      connectors from inside to outside the box with actual
                      connectors that plug in so that the box is independent
                      from other parts on the boat, and so that water can not
                      get in from the pass through connectors. Finally, we hope
                      to work with the Mechanical team about where best to place
                      the batteries and our electronics box on the boat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the communications side, we are hoping to buy updated
                      tech for the GPS and Wifi systems. We are also planning on
                      using the LED tower to communicate more than just RC modes
                      and thruster power. We hope that we can find ways for the
                      LEDs to show if the computer is powered, if the thrusters
                      are powered, and various communication connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Overall, the EE team would like to create a very generic
                      system that utilizes modules that can be added and removed
                      depending on what sensor payloads the boat is carrying,
                      and which tasks we plan to do at the next RoboBoat
                      competition.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Finance</h3>
                    <p>
                      Business Team this year decided to change our organization
                      structure in order to better coordinate different
                      sponsorships. Before, only Business Team was in charge of
                      talking to sponsors. However, when sponsors want to talk
                      to specific subteams (Autonomy, EE, or MechE) about
                      technical questions, subteams are able to offer more
                      detailed and accurate explanations than Business Team. So
                      this year, Business Team will not only keep track of all
                      sponsorships as we’ve done before, we will also build a
                      system where we assign sponsorships to specific subteams
                      as points of contact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While we are working on recruiting new members for
                      Business Team now, we are also getting ready for meeting
                      our sponsors before and after MIT’s Fall Career Fair,
                      which will take place on Sept. 22. We are currently
                      scheduling info sessions or recruiting events that our
                      sponsors can host at Arcturus, either on-site or remotely.

                        still working on getting <i>Ship Happens</i> sent back
                        from Norway, where we did the Njord Challenge. In
                        reality, we are looking at a maximum of five months’
                        time for us to get everything working and integrated,
                        which is very tight.

                        RoboBoat is currently set to start on our first day of
                        Spring classes. Many professors have mandatory
                        attendance during the first lecture to validate your
                        registration or risk losing your spot to someone on the
                        waitlist, so it’s unclear how many students would be
                        willing and able to attend the competition.

                    <p>
                      After some serious consideration, Arcturus has decided we
                      will not compete in RoboBoat 2024. Instead, we will focus
                      on building a whole new boat. There is simply too much on
                      each subteam’s plate. In summary:
                    </p>

                      <li>MechE is building a new vehicle altogether which:</li>

                          thus easier to deploy
                        </li>

                        and will focus on:
                      </li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Adapting to our new steering</li>

                      </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      Until we consistently can accomplish several tasks, we
                      don’t think it’s worth the significant practical and
                      financial hurdles to go to RoboBoat. Furthermore, because
                      this is our third year, we no longer get registration for
                      free, so we would have to pay to enter again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We believe that there are many benefits of competitions
                      including team bonding and condensed testing, but we also
                      think that competing isn’t the only method which would do
                      this. Many other Edgerton Center teams go on “field trips”
                      where they bring their vehicles to tracks or scrimmages to
                      test or compete informally. We are considering doing
                      something similar either within Massachusetts or in a
                      nearby state. We are reaching out to UMichigan to see if
                      they would be interested in setting up a course together
                      for practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Deciding to take a year off poses a great opportunity for
                      MIT Arcturus to focus on our technology and development as
                      a team. This is especially relevant as many of our ‘24s
                      are graduating out, so we would like to dedicate much of
                      our energy towards recruiting and training underclassmen
                      during this time. In the long run, we believe this move
                      will better prepare the team for success when we begin
                      competing again.

                    <p>
                      After a long week of hard work, we’re proud to say
                      Arcturus placed first in design documentation, team video,
                      and website in RoboBoat 2023! This Sunday we ran a debrief
                      discussing what went right and wrong at RoboBoat, where we
                      want to be going as a team, some potential new leadership
                      structures as we prepare for long term continuity, and
                      interest and logistics for the

                      >.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What we need to improve</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Connecting different subteams - have EE/mechE and nav
                        work more closely so that there isn’t a weird divide and
                        everyone is on the same page for system integration.
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Testing earlier and more frequently!</b></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          We should be in the water by the end of the fall
                          semester at the latest so we know what needs to be
                          fixed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          We need to have a hardware freeze by the end of the
                          first semester so nav can work on programming the boat
                          and debug.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          We should breeze through safety checks in the first
                          day to maximize the number of slots we get on the
                          water during competition.

                    <h3>Takeaways and recommendations for next season</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        We need to put a hard deadline to stop building earlier
                        so that we don’t spend time building things that don’t
                        have time to get integrated and give nav more time to
                        integrate.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b
                          >More tests! We need to get in the water more
                          frequently - but in order to test, we need to have
                          programming done earlier in the season.</b
                        >
                      </li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Testing more also means we have more data to share!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          To this end, Njord Challenge will be super helpful
                          actually because it’ll encourage us to focus on
                          programming in the coming months since there are no
                          mechanical tasks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          But we don’t want our EE and mechE’s to get bored so
                          after we finish a vehicle and hand it off to nav, we
                          should do another new project and cycle on/off season
                          for hardware vs software for a given vehicle.

                              EE and mechE wrap up the sub and design RoboBoat
                              modules.

                            <li>
                              Nav begins programming for modules and refines
                              navigation tasks.

                            <li>
                              If time: begin thinking about RoboSub or other
                              submarine competitions and begin implementing
                              approaches to those tasks.

                      <li>
                        Programming first: instead of having our mechE’s ask
                        “can you program it to do x” have nav tell mechE “here’s
                        what is easiest for us to implement, create a mechanical
                        system which can do this.”

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          In many ways this is a more interesting task for
                          mechE’s.
                        </li>
                        <li>Enables nav and mechE to work in parallel.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>
                        We still want to work hard to give people training when
                        we get back since we have many freshmen on the team.

                          Connect new members to shop staff so that you can get
                          to know them better and feel comfortable asking them
                          questions.

                        In order to speed up efficiency of manufacturing, we’re
                        creating a part tracking system so that anyone can go to
                        the IDC (a machine shop we use), look at the doc, and
                        start prints or cut parts for others.

                          We need to know where things will go on the boat a lot

                          Having a travel manager is good! Someone needs to
                          manage who’s going where and when AND they should be
                          there at the competition to see it through!

                        <li>
                          We should ask Milwaukee Tool for more packout boxes to
                          hold stuff since the cardboard ones aren’t enough.
                        </li>

                          <li>
                            Should also get our own set of tools (pliers,
                            calipers, etc) if possible.

                            Also would be nice to have smaller boxes with
                            subdividers for electronics and fasteners.

                          Someone should be the designated testing director who
                          makes sure batteries are charged, tools are in hand,
                          etc. every time we are going out to test to take

                        The packing list was started too late and we forgot a
                        lot of things, we’re lucky multiple trips had to be made
                        anyway

                        Senior members were too busy with individual tasks to
                        direct new members who ended up standing around with
                        little to do much of the time

                      <li>
                        The purpose of the test and information on the vehicles
                        wasn’t clear to a lot of new members
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hardware-software integration was not ready which meant
                        having to take the boat out of the pool a lot to fix
                        things, wasting testing time

                      <li>
                        No GPS fix at all in the pool, as opposed to just a poor

                    <p>
                      Following RoboBoat 2022, we have done a comprehensive
                      debrief and have several goals for this season:
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Rework electronic systems:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Last season, a reverse polarity power cable fried several
                      key electronics on our boat -- including our computer, an
                      Intel NUC. As a result, we had to scramble to reconfigure
                      for a backup computer we had brought. We want to make sure
                      we have redundancies in place so a similar mistake won’t
                      happen again. In particular, we want to implement
                      overcurrent protection by investigating the use of fuses,
                      diodes, optoisolators, switch boards, microcontroller
                      choice, and voltage regulation. We also would like to try
                      designing our own PCB boards, since this is a skill which
                      isn’t really taught in our course curriculum and we think
                      it would be interesting to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to make this happen, we plan on:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>

                    <p><strong>Make the boat lighter:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      We have done a massive recruiting push this semester,
                      tripling the size of our team. As such, we believe we will
                      have the manpower to approach all the tasks this year and
                      we think that attempting all tasks will be a good learning
                      experience for the team. In order to make programming as
                      easy as possible, we must ensure that mechanical modules
                      are consistent and reliable. This will require an
                      increased focus on quantitative and qualitative testing,
                      system integration, and careful planning and pacing to
                      ensure we aren’t pressed for time.
                    </p>

                        >On top of competing in RoboBoat 2023, we will also be
                        building an autonomous underwater vehicle.</strong
                      >
                      We’re unsure if we will be able to finish our sub in time
                      for a competition this year, though, so this will depend
                      on manpower. We will spend the first semester building the
                      sub and overhauling our electronics on our boat, then hand
                      the boat off to programming mid-semester.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This is pretty ambitious, so we're doing the following
                      <strong>structural changes within the team</strong> to
                      make it happen:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Improved onboarding.</strong> We are working on
                        creating step by step guides to help people learn (and
                        remember!) how to use the machines (laser cutters, 3D
                        printers, etc.), safely charge the LiPo batteries, and
                        use Ardupilot, the autopilot software that we use. We
                        are also hoping to hold workshops early on to help
                        people learn CAD, electronics, and other skills they'll
                        need to be set up for success and hit the ground
                        running. We are hoping to hold these weekly for the next
                        few weeks. More details on this to come!

                          >Increased focus on on-the-water testing.</strong
                        >
                        With more testing comes more feedback for both our
                        design and programming teams. We are planning many more
                        tests this semester and are setting our design deadlines
                        accordingly. We are also coordinating with the Z-center
                        so that we can use their pool during the winter months
                        when the Charles River freezes over.

                        >
                        We've put together a team Notion which we will be using
                        to organize the team as a whole. Included in the Notion
                        are parts order requests, task list, meeting notes,
                        linktree, team roster, team roadmap, and comprehensive
                        wikis by subteam. We are currently working on an overall
                        gantt chart of all the deadlines and milestones we're
                        looking to accomplish, which will allow us to make sure
                        all the dominoes are placed in succession.

                      <li>
                        <strong>Launching Arcturus Finance.</strong> As you
                        know, we've been having some trouble recruiting for our
                        business team, which has always seemed to take a
                        backseat to the technical roles in the team as many of
                        us are mechanical/software engineers. But we also
                        understand that there is a massive community of students
                        in Sloan who might be interested in this kind of
                        opportunity. It's just a matter of finding them. Which
                        is why we’re building a new team, Arcturus Finance. By
                        separating our business team into a separate ASA club,
                        we'd ensure that finance would get the full spotlight it
                        deserves and hopefully garner some of the interest other
                        finance clubs draw at MIT. It would allow everyone to
                        focus on the parts of Arcturus they're most interested
                        in, be it robotics, finance, or both! It'd be a very
                        different approach to the way most engineering teams
                        have managed their funding, but we think it has the
                        potential to be incredibly valuable for everyone
                        involved. In this way, we hope to create an
                        interdisciplinary experience which combines both
                        technical and management skills, mirroring the structure
                        of real-world companies and startups.
                      </li>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                        <strong>Recruiting.</strong> Since we are a 2024 and
                        mechE heavy team, we are looking to recruit more members
                        of different years from different departments. We
                        believe this will be crucial to keep our team balanced
                        and ensure its legacy after we graduate. We see a
                        particular need for electrical engineers and programmers
                        experienced in autonomy, as well as freshmen and
                        sophomores to bring new life into the team. And of
                        course, if we are approaching two competitions this
                        semester, we will need more hands on deck in general, so
                        we are looking to expand as a whole. We will be running
                        lab tours for the next two weeks for prospective
                        members. Interest tours for technicals will be 9/10 and
                        9/11 at 3 PM and 9/12 and 9/15 at 5:30 PM. Interest
                        tours for Arcturus Finance will be 9/19, 9/22, and 9/23
                        at 5:30 PM.

                      <li>
                        <strong>Feedback and leadership.</strong> In order to
                        get feedback from the team, we’ve sent out a feedback
                        form to get input. We want to make sure that everyone
                        has enough hands-on work this semester and feels they’re
                        picking up practical skills they’re interested in, so
                        this will be important for us to know when assigning
                        tasks. We also wanted to open up leadership to more
                        underclassmen since almost all of our leadership are
                        currently in the class of 2024, and we want to plan for
                        long-term longevity. As such, we have decided to do away
                        with a traditional “exec” and instead have a logistics
                        team. The logistics team meets each week to plan
                        out…well, logistics, for the team as a whole. Our first
                        logistics meeting this Sunday (11th) at 2 PM in Sea
                        Grant, where we will discuss overall plans for the
                        semester, onboarding plans, and preliminary designs.

                      <br />
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                      Our first general meeting including new members will be on
                      September 18th at 2 PM. We’re excited to get started!
