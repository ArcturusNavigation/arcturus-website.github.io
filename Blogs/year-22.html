                        One of the first tasks our team worked on was buoy
                        detection. Most of the navigation courses in Roboboat
                        require us to identify buoys and then figure out how to
                        navigate them. Using a ZED camera, we developed the
                        following algorithmic steps to properly identify buoys
                        on the course:
                      </p>
                      <p>Performs erosion with a segmentation kernel</p>
                      <p>
                        Performs dilation with the same segementation kernel
                      </p>
                      <p>Converts the image to HSV</p>
                      <p>
                        Gets the mask for each color range we are looking
                        at(red, green, yellow)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Generates a bounding box for each disjoint blob in the
                        color range mask
                      </p>

                        Our controller is a Pixhawk 4 running Ardupilot. It
                        takes in GPS waypoint coordinates and headings and
                        handles the motor commands to achieve the desired
                        position and heading. For the two main navigation tasks,
                        we plan to first identify them and head to the position
                        shown in each of the above figures on the left. Then, we
                        will run through pre-planned paths that are adjusted in
                        realtime by a local planner for obstacle avoidance. The
                        preplanned paths are shown visualized in RVIZ in the
                        above figures on the right.

                      <h3>Current Status</h3>
                      <p>
                        For those who are unfamiliar with the structure of MIT
                        Arcturus, we split up into subteams to complete tasks
                        and work on our competition boat in an efficient manner.
                        One of such subteams solely focuses on the boat itself
                        and in doing so, plays an integral role in creating a
                        foundational structure to support the work being done by
                        the other subteams. As the primary focus of this team is
                        the hardware of the vessel itself, like the hull and the
                        integrated electronics that allow it to function, we
                        have merged these two elements into the wonderful field
                        of engineering known to us as Hullectronics.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So far, we have fully assembled the frame of our test
                        boat (coined CatamaROV) and are starting to install
                        azimuthal thrusters, which we usually will call azipods.
                        The design of this thruster implementation has been an
                        entire subteam effort. We have each been taking on
                        separate tasks as well as one component of the azipod
                        design, which we hope to test ASAP on CatamaROV.

                      <p>
                        Val and Sebastian have been working through the kinks on
                        our azipod-to-hull mount this week among other things.
                        While doing that, Val has been looking ahead and
                        ordering parts we will soon be needing to finalize
                        CatamaROV and Sebastian has been preparing our
                        waterproof “dry boxes” which house all of the
                        electronics for the boat. Penelope finished fabricating
                        the bearing attachments for the azipods, which are
                        responsible for transferring all the thrust from the
                        azipod to the boat itself. Meanwhile, Ansel finished
                        mapping all of the controls with the Ardupilot and wired
                        up all the components in the dry boxes that Sebastian
                        helped to solder.

                      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                      <p>
                        With most of CatamaROV coming together, we have to
                        coordinate with our Navigations subteam to determine a
                        testing schedule so that we can test some of the
                        experimental elements of our design while also making
                        sure they have the most useful testing platform possible
                        so that we can start focusing on the design and
                        fabrication of our final boat.

                      <h3>Recent Developments</h3>
                      <p>
                        We just completed our first field test with CatamaROV
                        this week! This was one of the first times we were able
                        to get it out on the water to test its speed and
                        maneuverability. Testing in our two tanks are great for
                        some aspects, but out on the Charles we confirmed that
                        our three azipod layout would indeed give us the
                        flexibility we need to make complex maneuvers like tight
                        turns at both low and high speeds. We also confirmed
                        what we already knew about our preliminary azipod
                        design, that we are going to need to i crease its
                        supporting substructure for our scaled up final hull.
                        Overall, the tests were a success!
                      </p>
                      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                      <p>
                        Moving forward, we can start applying what we verified
                        in our testing to the design of the final hull. Time
                        permitting (on both the Hullectronics and Navigations
                        side of things), we will fabricate and install three
                        azipods into our final hull after a redesign to
                        compensate for our larger final vessel. We already have
                        some ideas for the new azipod design and after some
                        conversations between subteams (and some calculations we
                        ran around buoyancy to ensure we can reuse this boat for
                        future projects) we have decided fully on a catamaran
                        structure going forward.

                      <h3>Current Status</h3>
                      <p>
                        After successful trials with our test boat (CatamaROV),
                        we are finalizing our designs and are looking to
                        fabricate our final hull. With sustainability in mind,
                        we will try and repurpose a foam-fiberglass hull that we
                        had built previously to meet our design specifications.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Recent Developments</h3>
                      <p>
                        Our new catamaran hulls have been cut down to size and
                        are now in the process of getting the epoxy and
                        fiberglass lay-up done. Sebastian and Yasin have been
                        working on the aluminum frame of the boat that will hold
                        the two hulls together and Ansel has been procuring
                        materials for the deck that will hold all of the
                        electronics on the vessel.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Jessica is working on adapting our azimuth thruster
                        design to these new catamaran hulls. Adding several
                        layers of structural support to these thruster elements
                        will ensure this vital component is as secure as
                        possible without sacrificing functionality. While the
                        azipod thrusters will take some time to finish, it is
                        imperative that we complete the hull and deck
                        fabrication in a timely manner to allow our Navigations
                        subteam the necessary time to mount the sensor suite for
                        calibration.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Goals and Timeline</h3>
                      <p>
                        After finalizing our azipod thrusters and finishing the
                        hull retrofit, we will start to look at finishing the
                        fabrication of the deck between our hulls at the start
                        of next week. We will be modifying this bridge heavily
                        in the coming weeks as we go in order to suit the
                        specific challenges of this competition and provide a
                        strong structural foundation for the Navigations and
                        Task Force subteams\' components.

                      <h3>Let's Get This Drone to Fly</h3>
                      <p>
                        This week welcomed a new member of Drone Zone, Erin! At
                        the beginning of this week we had our drone physically
                        assembled, but it needed a lot of work to get the
                        electronics finished. Ita and Audrey created some
                        monster wires to send consistent and equal power to all
                        four of the motors. Once that was done, Erin was
                        immediately working on the computer. Our drone was set
                        up with a Pixhawk autopilot, but for unknown reasons we
                        did not pass half of the flight checks to get the motors
                        to start spinning. We turned all of them off, and one by
                        one turned the checks back on, troubleshooting until we
                        got the drone to fly consistently.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At the same time, the Landing Gear team was just
                        finishing up their prototype to allow the drone to land
                        on the boat. They had a series of mag jigs connected
                        together by a timing belt to turn the magnets “on” and
                        “off” at once. With their new design, the drone should
                        be able to land consistently, but we will have to switch
                        our landing gear from regular legs to a thin metal ring.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Currently on track with our timeline, we should have the
                        two parts working together by the end of the month. We
                        will be handing off the two prototypes to navigation so
                        they can start programming them autonomously.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Change of plans</h3>
                      <p>
                        We have just discovered there is no drone in this year's
                        competition. To accommodate these changes, Drone Zone
                        and Landing Gear will be merging teams into Task Force.
                        Task Force will be working on the water gun and skeeball
                        portions of the competition. We will be focusing the
                        upcoming week on creating a new timeline, and deciding
                        how we want to approach the new tasks.

                        and deciding on an aiming system, we are looking forward
                        to the skeeball shooter. Since we do not yet know the
                        exact dimensions for the skeeball shooter, we want to be
                        a module as possible for the design. We are splitting
                        Task Force into 3 teams, one will work on a flywheel
                        (Audrey, Isa), one will work on an extending arm
                        (Jessica, Richard), and the final will be working on a
                        crossbow design (Erin, Via).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Flywheel: The flywheel will be a wheel attached to the
                        motor, close to a solid wall. As a ball is fed through,
                        it will be shot ahead by the wheels. We like this idea
                        because there are lots of examples of it from FTC, and
                        it's pretty easy to build.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Crossbow: The crossbow design uses a spring to shoot the
                        ball. The ball will be loaded in, and the spring slowly
                        cranked backwards until it's ready to shoot. This idea
                        looks good because it should be very consistent with
                        every throw, and we have a lot of modularity with a
                        single design by changing the size of the barrel, and
                        the spring.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Extending Arm: The extending arm would be paired with
                        one of the other two designs. It will extend beyond the
                        initial measurements of the boat to accurately deliver
                        the balls.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        All of these designs need to be compatible with the
                        hull, in terms of power consumed as well as size.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Upcoming Goals</h3>
                      <p>
                        We need to finish up these prototypes as soon as
                        possible. A finished product will be given to the
                        Navigation team so they can begin to plan for and
                        program the aiming system. This week we plan to have a
                        CAD model for each of the designs, and order any
                        required materials.
