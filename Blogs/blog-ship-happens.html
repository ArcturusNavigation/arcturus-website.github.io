              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>Following RoboBoat 2022, we have done a comprehensive debrief and have several goals for this season:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Rework electronic systems:</strong></p>
                <p>Last season, a reverse polarity power cable fried several key electronics on our boat -- including our computer, an Intel NUC. As a result, we had to scramble to reconfigure for a backup computer we had brought. We want to make sure we have redundancies in place so a similar mistake won’t happen again. In particular, we want to implement overcurrent protection by investigating the use of fuses, diodes, optoisolators, switch boards, microcontroller choice, and voltage regulation. We also would like to try designing our own PCB boards, since this is a skill which isn’t really taught in our course curriculum and we think it would be interesting to learn.</p>
                <p>In order to make this happen, we plan on:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Doing a comprehensive “roadkill” (layout of all powered devices) before worrying about component placement.</li>
                  <li>Finding more members who are specialized or interested in learning EE.</li>
                  <li>Create handbooks members can reference for Ardupilot, CAD/CAM, and battery handling.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Make the boat lighter:</strong></p>
                <p>We have done a massive recruiting push this semester, tripling the size of our team. As such, we believe we will have the manpower to approach all the tasks this year and we think that attempting all tasks will be a good learning experience for the team. In order to make programming as easy as possible, we must ensure that mechanical modules are consistent and reliable. This will require an increased focus on quantitative and qualitative testing, system integration, and careful planning and pacing to ensure we aren’t pressed for time.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>On top of competing in RoboBoat 2023, we will also be building an autonomous underwater vehicle.</strong> We’re unsure if we will be able to finish our sub in time for a competition this year, though, so this will depend on manpower. We will spend the first semester building the sub and overhauling our electronics on our boat, then hand the boat off to programming mid-semester.</p>

                <p>This is pretty ambitious, so we're doing the following <strong>structural changes within the team</strong> to make it happen:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Improved onboarding.</strong> We are working on creating step by step guides to help people learn (and remember!) how to use the machines (laser cutters, 3D printers, etc.), safely charge the LiPo batteries, and use Ardupilot, the autopilot software that we use. We are also hoping to hold workshops early on to help people learn CAD, electronics, and other skills they'll need to be set up for success and hit the ground running. We are hoping to hold these weekly for the next few weeks. More details on this to come!</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Increased focus on on-the-water testing.</strong> With more testing comes more feedback for both our design and programming teams. We are planning many more tests this semester and are setting our design deadlines accordingly. We are also coordinating with the Z-center so that we can use their pool during the winter months when the Charles River freezes over.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Improved organization and increased emphasis on meeting deadlines.</strong> We've put together a team Notion which we will be using to organize the team as a whole. Included in the Notion are parts order requests, task list, meeting notes, linktree, team roster, team roadmap, and comprehensive wikis by subteam. We are currently working on an overall gantt chart of all the deadlines and milestones we're looking to accomplish, which will allow us to make sure all the dominoes are placed in succession.</li>

                  <li><strong>Launching Arcturus Finance.</strong> As you know, we've been having some trouble recruiting for our business team, which has always seemed to take a backseat to the technical roles in the team as many of us are mechanical/software engineers. But we also understand that there is a massive community of students in Sloan who might be interested in this kind of opportunity. It's just a matter of finding them. Which is why we’re building a new team, Arcturus Finance. By separating our business team into a separate ASA club, we'd ensure that finance would get the full spotlight it deserves and hopefully garner some of the interest other finance clubs draw at MIT. It would allow everyone to focus on the parts of Arcturus they're most interested in, be it robotics, finance, or both! It'd be a very different approach to the way most engineering teams have managed their funding, but we think it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for everyone involved. In this way, we hope to create an interdisciplinary experience which combines both technical and management skills, mirroring the structure of real-world companies and startups.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Recruiting.</strong> Since we are a 2024 and mechE heavy team, we are looking to recruit more members of different years from different departments. We believe this will be crucial to keep our team balanced and ensure its legacy after we graduate. We see a particular need for electrical engineers and programmers experienced in autonomy, as well as freshmen and sophomores to bring new life into the team. And of course, if we are approaching two competitions this semester, we will need more hands on deck in general, so we are looking to expand as a whole. We will be running lab tours for the next two weeks for prospective members. Interest tours for technicals will be 9/10 and 9/11 at 3 PM and 9/12 and 9/15 at 5:30 PM. Interest tours for Arcturus Finance will be 9/19, 9/22, and 9/23 at 5:30 PM.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Feedback and leadership.</strong> In order to get feedback from the team, we’ve sent out a feedback form to get input. We want to make sure that everyone has enough hands-on work this semester and feels they’re picking up practical skills they’re interested in, so this will be important for us to know when assigning tasks. We also wanted to open up leadership to more underclassmen since almost all of our leadership are currently in the class of 2024, and we want to plan for long-term longevity. As such, we have decided to do away with a traditional “exec” and instead have a logistics team. The logistics team meets each week to plan out…well, logistics, for the team as a whole. Our first logistics meeting this Sunday (11th) at 2 PM in Sea Grant, where we will discuss overall plans for the semester, onboarding plans, and preliminary designs.</li>
                  <br>
                </ol>

                <p>Our first general meeting including new members will be on September 18th at 2 PM. We’re excited to get started!</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                  <p>We have mostly finished CADding the boat! This includes designs for our ball scooper, ball launcher, and thruster azipods (rotating thrusters that will make our turning radius smaller in the water). Manufacturing has started for the ball launcher and will continue when we come back in January.</p>
                  <br>
                  
                  <p><u>Subteam 1: Task-Ponce de Leon / Fountain of Youth</u></p>
                  <p>No mechanical changes have been made to this mechanism. Last season, we simply did not get to this task in competition, but from our testing we believe that the mechanism we set out to spray water last season should work again. </p>
                  <br>

                  <p><u>Subteam 2: Task- Feed the fish</u></p>
                  <p>We finished the finalized the first version of the ball launcher. The system is divided into three main subsections: the revolver, the turret, the shooter. The revolver holds all the balls and controls when they are deposited into the shooter. The turret allows the shooter to rotate so we can aim independent of the boat's positions and the shooter is the flywheel system that launches the balls.</p>
                  <p>The revolver/ball deposit system is modeled after the ball drop arcade game. There are slots for the balls to sit in and a servo rotates a plate to move the balls until one eventually falls through the hole to the shooter. We went with this system because it utilizes only one moving part and we can reliably ensure that only one ball goes into the shooter at a time. All the balls are also stored horizontally which is an additional benefit because we want to minimize obstruction to the lidar. We also included a 3D printed dome to prevent balls deposited from the ball collection system from staying in the center of the plate or falling and damaging the servo.</p>
                  <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center pb-3">
                    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 align-items-center justify-content-center d-flex">
                      <img src="../Pictures/Blogs/ship-happens-12-15-22-ME-pic1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </div>
                  </div>

                  <p>The turret is controlled by a 180 degree servo. A small gear attached to the servo controls a larger ring gear that is connected to the rest of the system. The gears are laser cut out of ⅛” aluminum and stacked for a final height of ¼”. Originally we planned for the pieces to be made of acrylic because they could easily be cut for exact sizes, but after meeting with Chandler Griffin of iSensys recommended we go with metal because acrylic tends to crack easily. The turret is attached to the underside of the revolver so that the pivot point of the turret is concentric to where the balls drop.</p>
                  <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center pb-3">
                    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 align-items-center justify-content-center d-flex">
                      <img src="../Pictures/Blogs/ship-happens-12-15-22-ME-pic2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">

                  </div>

                  <p>The shooter is powered by a 6,000 rpm goBilda yellow jacket series motor. We haven’t found the ideal speed the flywheels should rotate at, but we decided to go with the fastest motor in the GoBilda series because the flywheel speed is more of a concern than the amount of torque. The motor is belted to the flywheel with the ability to easily change the gearing ratio. We also went with a belted drive so the motor could be placed such that the center of mass is as symmetrical as possible. The flywheel has a rubber tread which provides grip and compression to help launch the racquetballs. Once the ball drops into through the hole in the revolver the ball makes contact with the flywheel and is compressed between the flywheel and the ramp to gain rotational speed before being launched out. The shooter connects to the turret through two tabs that go into the ring gear. The shooter also has a delrin plastic bottom to support the weight of the shooter instead of the tabs and to increase the friction between the shooter and the deck.</p>

                  <p><u>Subteam 3: Task-Ocean Clean up</u></p>
                  <p>At the last team time, we learned that the boat cannot drive into the enclosure with the balls so we moved forwards with the arm and elevator system. A spring loaded PVC arm with a sliding L piece is spring loaded and released when the boat approaches the task. The boat drives around the perimeter of the enclosure collecting balls. Once all the balls have been collected the L arm is reeled in with a winch to collect all the balls into one location. An elevator mechanism on the side of the boat will then pick up all the balls and deposit them into the revolver on the ball launcher.</p>

                  <p><u>Subteam 4: Azimuth Thrusters</u></p>
                  <p>In our azimuth thruster design, a servo is connected on one side of a 1.7” diameter, PVC pipe, and a thruster is connected on the other, allowing the servo to rotate the entire subsystem. This subsystem is mounted inside a larger 2.4” diameter PVC pipe with Delrin bushings so the thrusters can easily rotate and be lifted into the hull during transport.</p>

                  <p>A 2.5” in hole will be drilled 6” inches from the top for the larger pvc to be mounted to and a 5” inch hole will be drilled 5”  inches from the bottom to create a channel for the thruster to rest when the system is retracted.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                  <p>From the tasks, it looks like we need to be able to collect balls from the water after detecting their location from a pinger, shoot balls into a skeeball board, and shoot water into a target. The last two tasks are the same as last year, so we plan to use the experience we gain through building and testing to make necessary improvements.</p>
                  <br>
                  
                  <p><u>Subteam 1: Task-Ponce de Leon / Fountain of Youth</u></p>
                  <p>This task is very similar to the water gun task from last year with the main difference being the location of the target point. We decided to use the same mechanism from last year to complete this task. For this, we have a pump that continuously draws in water from the lake so we have a virtually infinite supply of water and two servos to control aiming. The pump we purchased last year has the specs to shoot water at the height required for the aiming system (figure below) which is compact, light, and works fairly well.</p>
                  <p>Next steps: Hand Mechanism to navigation to begin programming and testing.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p><u>Subteam 2: Task- Feed the fish</u></p>
                  <p>This task is almost exactly the same as the skeeball task. Last year we used a linear slide mechanism to deposit the balls into the buckets. After building and testing we realized that the bulkiness and weight of having an arm extend out two feet was not worth the additional accuracy provided. The racquetballs are relatively small compared to the bucket with a fair amount of room for error. Thus this year we decided to move forward with a flywheel ball launching mechanism. A flywheel will rotate quickly compressing the racquetball against a 3D printed ramp and launch the ball. A turret will be implemented to give control of the x,y position of the ball and the speed of the flywheel can be adjusted to control the height the ball is launched. We will begin a CAD design of this soon.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p><u>Subteam 3: Task-Ocean Clean up</u></p>
                  <p>Ocean Clean up is a completely new task introduced this year so we immediately went into brainstorming to find potential mechanisms. We were initially deciding between a net that would mount inside the area between the hulls to collect delivery balls and an arm that extends outwards to collect the balls.</p>
                  <p>The net is mounted between the hulls; one side is free to pivot and the other side is attached to a winch to control the height. The net will be lowered and the boat will drive through the area with the balls and once the balls are collected the net will be raised.  The net would be well-supported by both hulls and any actuators required to move the balls can be mounted to top of the boat. The downside to the water well mechanism is we are unsure if we will be able to go inside the region where the balls are located.</p>
                  <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center pb-3">
                    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 align-items-center justify-content-center d-flex">

                  </div>

                  <p>The alternative method we discussed was an arm that reaches into the enclosure to collect the balls. A PVC arm is spring loaded to the side of the boat and will be released when we approach the region with the balls. The boat will drive around the perimeter collecting balls.A sliding L PVC piece is attached to the arm and can be pulled in with a winch system. The L PVC piece will ensure all the balls end up in a corner near the side of the hull. There will be a separate elevator on the side of the hull that takes the collected balls to the ball launcher. Because the pvc extends beyond the boat we are going to add pool noodles on the L slides so that it's supported by the buoyancy force. We also wanted to test how well the pvc would work at herding the balls so we did a couple of tests (video and photo shown below). The downside to this mechanism is that there are significantly more moving parts and therefore a higher risk for failure.</p>

                  <p><u>Subteam 4: Azimuth Thrusters</u></p>
                  <p>One problem we wanted to tackle this season was the lack of maneuverability of our competition boat, Ship Happens. In the previous season, our boat struggled to make small maneuvers to prevent it from drifting into obstacles since the thrusters were locked in place. Ship Happens was able to rotate by powering one thruster in one direction and the other in the opposite direction. While this simple strategy worked for large rotations to point the robot in a general direction, it was difficult to make precise movements since it took around 2.5 seconds to rotate 90 degrees and since our thruster layout did not allow any form of strafing.</p>
                  <p>Another smaller issue with our previous thrusters was that they needed to be screwed on and off the 8020s they were attached to every time our robot was deployed. This made the process of deploying Ship Happens inefficient, and prompted us to develop a more modular design for placing the thrusters and efficiently deploying our robot.</p>
                  <p>This year we are planning to implement a retractable azimuth thruster to provide additional maneuverability for alignment tasks. Retracting the thruster into the hull of the boat for transport would help protect the thrusters and simplify the deploying and retrieval process. A servo controls a pvc strut attached to a thruster, thus rotating it in place and changing the angle of thrust force relative to the boat.</p>

                  <p>Last Friday, we finally got our boat into the Charles River to test wifi range and collect data on buoys in the water using the LiDAR and Zed camera. We found that our wifi is able to connect until the boat is about 40 meters away. The buoy data will help us program the boat to find and navigate around buoys depending on their colors as outlined in the RoboBoat guidelines, and it was a good chance for our members to practice setting up the boat and putting it in the water.</p>

                  <p>We are working on onboarding new members, which have already been divided into sub-project teams. Because the sub team has increased from about 4 members last year to about 20 active members this season, the team lead, Herbie, has implemented version control so that multiple members can work on the same project. It is important to make sure that changes in code propagate to everyone working on it, and that if mistakes are made, we can revert back to old, working versions of the code. To do this, Herbie is using Git and Github.</p>
